RNA structure is key to its function. Main RNA structural features include:
  -> negatively charged ribose–phosphate chain, makes up two-thirds of the mass of a nucleotide 
  -> bases, which account for the remaining third of mass
  -> bases stack like coins in a roll with no space between them for solvent
  -> Stacked bases are ∼3.4 Å apart
  -> “Structured” RNAs adopt one highly populated state but is not static
  -> “unstructured” RNA has no favored state; still, likely some specific states will be more populated
  -> prediction algos like Mfold are based on thermodynamics. Alternative pairing possibilities with theoretically higher free energies 
      are generally ignored. The danger of only considering the lowest free-energy structure is that the community ends up taking an untested possibility at face value.

Main goal of the model is to predic the reactivity of the RNA bases to 2 chemical substances. These substances are commonly used to infer about the RNA structure.

Packages using a physics-based approach (assigns thermodynamic values to a set of structural features): ViennaRNA, NUPACK and RNAstructure.
Their parameters traditionally characterized via optical melting experiments and then generalized by experts. 
Other approaches (statistical learning methods to derive parameters for structural features): RNAsoft, CONTRAfold, CycleFold, LearnToFold, MXfold, SPOT-RNA.
 -> The study evaluates the performance of packages in two tasks including predicting chemical reactivity data through calculating probabilities that nucleotides are unpaired.
 -> CONTRAfold and RNASoft perform better than packages that are in wider use.
 -> Chemical mapping is a widely used readout of RNA secondary structure.
 -> A nucleotide’s reactivity in a chemical mapping experiment depends on the availability of the nucleotide to be chemically modified, 
 -> and hence provides an ensemble-averaged readout of the nucleotide’s deprotection from base pairing or other binding partners. 
Structure prediction algorithms are able to estimate the ensemble-averaged probability that a nucleotide is paired or unpaired. 


Within each chemical mapping dataset, CD-HIT-EST72 was used to **filter sequences with greater than 80% redundancy** (excluding a shared 3′ primer binding site). 
Nucleotides with reactivities less than or equal to zero or greater than the 95th percentile of the dataset were removed from analysis. 
To test which model predicts reactivities best, 24 datasets of more than 38k construacts, 80-130 nuleotides in lenght were tested. First, the RNA sequence was designed, mapped experimentally,
..., and then packages were emplyoed to predict the reactivity. Experimental and prediciton findings were comapred giving the accuracy as spearmans corr. test. Best packages were CONTRAfold 2...
... and Vienna 2 60oC. More info: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01605-0#Sec9

Here, data we have is:
-> train_data.csv - the training data, with one experimental profile per row. Includes sequence id, sequence, experiment type (0 1), ... other ... & ..
   reactivity_0001, reactivity_0002,… - (float) an array of floating point numbers of the train data, should have the same length as the RNA sequence, ....
   which defines the reactivity profile for the RNA. These are the type of data that need to be predicted.
-> rmdb_data.csv - provides the majority of the sequence profiles available in the RNA Mapping DataBase in the same format as train_data.csv.
-> sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file. Separate sequence positions are put on separate rows.
   id - Integer (0,1,…) that identifies each sequence position in the sample submission. The sequences associated with each of these id values are provided in test_sequences.csv
-> test_sequences.csv - the test set sequences. id_min, id_max - (integer) Minimum and maximum id values for the test sequence in a correctly formatted submission file.
   sequence_id - (string) An arbitrary identifier like eee73c1836bc for each test sequence. sequence - (string) Describes the RNA sequence, a string of A, C, G, and U, 
   for which DMS and 2A3 reactivity needs to predicted and submitted in a file like sample_submission.csv.
   future - (Boolean) Sequences whose data will be collected after the start of the competition (but before final scoring) are labeled as 1.


TO DO: a) merge train_data & rmdb b) clean data c) split data & make a model d) train e)test f) evaluate
